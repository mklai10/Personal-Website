                        Escape Lavis is a small game coded mainly in 
                        Javascript, Html, and CSS. It uses Threejs, a 
                        Javascript 3D library, to render the 3D graphics 
                        on web as well as handle the animations. The 
                        frontend is developed using Html and CSS, this 
                        consists of the starting screen of the game as 
                        well as the HUD. The backend is made with Javascript 
                        and that contains all of the logic in movement 
                        as well as game states. Right now the game is just
                        to see how long one can survive, but i plan to
                        implement a way to properly escape and win.

                        This was a small project that I did for valentines.
                        This was made with Html, CSS, and Javascript.
                        The year that I made this was another year of being
                        single. So I decided what better way to get a valentines
                        other than sending them a heartfelt, handmade website
                        asking them to be your valentines. Except the fact that
                        this website never got sent to anyone nor was it heartfelt.
                        However, I have plans to continue developing this project
                        every coming valentines until I get a valentine.

                    <p class="contentText">
                        Discord Bot is a project I did in Java, using JDA to 
                        access Discord. JDA is a wrapper of Discord REST API's 
                        and also creates websocket-events for Java. This 
                        originally started as a music bot for the Discord server
                        that I was in, but it expanded to be capable of creating 
                        server profiles, playing heads or tails, and viewing user
                        profile pictures. It uses commands that users would input
                        to then do the action. A couple years back Discord disallowed 
                        the usage of music bots so that feature is no longer.
