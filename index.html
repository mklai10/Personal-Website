                    <p class="contentPara">
                        I'm an aspiring software developer currently
                        attending UBC. I'm doing a bachelors of science
                        with a major in computer science, as a 5th year 
                        student. I have one more term of school left 
                        which i'll be doing in September and I'll be 
                        finished all classes in December. <br> <br>

                        I have done two co-ops as QA Software Developers.
                        This meant that I had to coordinate and lead many 
                        test sprints as well as write and develop test cases 
                        for the code. I also interacted with many software 
                        developers to learn about best coding practices and 
                        patterns. These opportunities really helped me in 
                        getting experience in the work force and become familiar
                        with the agile process of software development which I 
                        have learned to love.<br> <br>
                        
                        Right now I am available to work and am working on 
                        a couple personal projects. <br> <br>
                        
                        On my free time I love to go  to the gym and play 
                        badminton with my friends. I  usually hike in the 
                        Summers, and my goal  for this year is to hike 
                        Panorama Ridge.

                    <p class="contentText">
                        Escape Lavis is a small game coded mainly in 
                        Javascript, Html, and CSS. It uses Threejs, a 
                        Javascript 3D library, to render the 3D graphics 
                        on web as well as handle the animations. The 
                        frontend is developed using Html and CSS, this 
                        consists of the starting screen of the game as 
                        well as the HUD. The backend is made with Javascript 
                        and that contains all of the logic in movement 
                        as well as game states. Right now the game is just
                        to see how long one can survive, but i plan to
                        implement a way to properly escape and win.

                        This was a small project that I did for valentines.
                        This was made with Html, CSS, and Javascript.
                        The year that I made this was another year of being
                        single. So I decided what better way to get a valentines
                        other than sending them a heartfelt, handmade website
                        asking them to be your valentines. Except the fact that
                        this website never got sent to anyone nor was it heartfelt.
                        However, I have plans to continue developing this project
                        every coming valentines until I get a valentine.

                    <p class="contentText">
                        Discord Bot is a project I did in Java, using JDA to 
                        access Discord. JDA is a wrapper of Discord REST API's 
                        and also creates websocket-events for Java. This 
                        originally started as a music bot for the Discord server
                        that I was in, but it expanded to be capable of creating 
                        server profiles, playing heads or tails, and viewing user
                        profile pictures. It uses commands that users would input
                        to then do the action.
